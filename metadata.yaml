description: "The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (Chymische Hochzeit Christiani\
  \ Rosencreutz anno 1459) was edited in 1616 in Strasbourg, and its anonymous authorship\
  \ is attributed to Johann Valentin Andreae. The Chymical Wedding is often described\
  \ as the third of the original manifestos of the mysterious \"Fraternity of the\
  \ Rose Cross\" (Rosicrucians), although it is markedly different from the Fama Fraternitatis\
  \ and Confessio Fraternitatis in style and in subject matter.\nIt is an allegoric\
  \ romance (story) divided into Seven Days, or Seven Journeys, like Genesis, and\
  \ tells us about the way Christian Rosenkreuz was invited to go to a wonderful castle\
  \ full of miracles, in order to assist the Chymical Wedding of the king and the\
  \ queen, that is, the husband and the bride.\nThis manifesto has been a source of\
  \ inspiration for poets, alchemists (the word \"chymical\" is an old form of \"\
  chemical\" and refers to alchemy—for which the 'Sacred Marriage' was the goal [1])\
  \ and dreamers, through the force of its initiation ritual with processions of tests,\
  \ purifications, death, resurrection, and ascension and also by its symbolism found\
  \ since the beginning with the invitation to Rosenkreutz to assist this Royal Wedding.\n\
  The invitation to the royal wedding includes the Monas Hieroglyphica associated\
  \ with John Dee.\nThere is some resemblance between this alchemical romance and\
  \ passages in the Bible such as:\nThe kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king,\
  \ which made a marriage for his son, and And when the king came in to see the guests,\
  \ he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: (Matthew 22:2,11 KJV)\n\
  And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven,\
  \ prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. (Revelation 21:2)\n From Wikipedia\
